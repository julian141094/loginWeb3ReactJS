## Getting Started üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

Hello, my name is Julian and this is my test of Login with Web3. If you wanna run the code, please install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

And then, run this please:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the test.

## Implemented Technologies

Please, let me show you all of tools that i used, to build this test:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.
- [Context API](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) - Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- [MetaMask](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/) - MetaMask is the trailblazing tool enabling user interactions and experience on Web3.
- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) - Etherscan is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for Ethereum, a decentralized smart contracts platform..
- And another more tools üòé .

You can check the rest on package.json file!

## Development Vision

When I develop this code, I try to maintain the atomic component design paradigm, making (where possible) for each element of the sections a specific functional component. Given the number of elements built, manage your communication in two main ways, the first is through a global state manager (Contex), and the second is through parent / child communication between the closest components. It should be noted that the greatest workload was not found in the user interface styles, but at a logical level, in the connections with the different APIs to obtain the ETH account data.

## Development Details / Issues

I had never had experience developing with Metamask, and connecting in this way to the users' cryptocurrency accounts, however, I was able to make the relevant queries, show the information and do what was necessary to interact with the Metamask extension to make the sending request. . This last part of sending, I could not test it because I could not obtain in a common time the amount of ETH necessary to make a transaction, since Faucet approves only a little.

Thank you very much for all the time and dedication, blessings! üôè
